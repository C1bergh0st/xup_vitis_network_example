# Companion Notebooks

## Distributed Alveo cards

The Dask class and Notebooks that use such class are only intended for systems where the Alveo cards are located in different systems, either different servers or different VMs.

For these type of scenarios you can use the Notebooks as it.

## Multiple Alveo cards in the same system

If you have multiple Alveo cards in the same system you can still reuse the Notebooks, but, some modifications are needed.

To begin with, we will use `pynq` to [identify how many Alveo cards are present in the system and their id](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pynq_alveo.html#multiple-cards).

```python
import pynq
for i in range(len(pynq.Device.devices)):
    print("{} {}".format(i, pynq.Device.devices[i].name))
```

An example output should look like this, where the first column is the id and the second one is the Alveo shell

```console
0 xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_3
1 xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2
2 xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_3
```

In this case, three cards are available. We are only interested in the Alveo U280. To use them the `Overlay` class in `pynq` allows us to specify the device where the `xclbin` file is downloaded.

In the companion Notebooks discard everything before **Download xclbin to workers*** and use this code to configure the Alveo cards. *Replace Alveo id accordingly.*

```python
from vnx_utils import *
import pynq
import numpy as np

xclbin = <xclbin filename replace>
ol_w0 = pynq.Overlay(xclbin, device=pynq.Device.devices[0])
ol_w1 = pynq.Overlay(xclbin, device=pynq.Device.devices[2])
```

You can reuse the rest of the Notebook after this point.
